### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!-- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...-->
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently loving Astro
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything
- Making an app with React Native with a friend
- Tinkering with a new app that would require Doordash API calls, but would make them very angry at me (goal would be to help users stop ordering doordash & save $!) This is a huge passion of mine. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-zenko/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was in my mom's arms when we went through the gates at Disneyworld on my 1st birthday. We won a truck, got to be in a parade, and I met Mickey :) I remember none of it.
