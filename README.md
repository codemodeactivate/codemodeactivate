### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Howdy!

I'm a mid-career professional that got interested in becoming a product owner. In doing so, I took a few agile courses and thought learning to actually code instead of just fumbling through tutorials might be a good idea. I've tinkered with WordPress and website creation for ~20 years. Remember angelfire.com? I do!

Anyway, I'm currently enrolled in a bootcamp ![edX](https://img.shields.io/badge/edX-%2302262B.svg?logo=edX&logoColor=white) and expect to finish in August 2023. I'm absolutely loving it and it's totally reignited my passion for development. At the end of the day, I truly just love creating things (or trying to), learning hard things, always being challenged, and constantly feeling like I'm terrible. I think that's why I love jiu jitsu so much, too.

I'm supplementing my learning with: ![Udemy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udemy-A435F0?style=for-the-badge&logo=Udemy&logoColor=white) ![FreeCodeCamp](https://img.shields.io/badge/Freecodecamp-%23123.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=freecodecamp&logoColor=green) ![Khan Academy](https://img.shields.io/badge/KhanAcademy-%2314BF96.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=KhanAcademy&logoColor=white), as well as [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io)
