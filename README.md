### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello there!

I'm an experienced professional who's cultivated a new passion for becoming a product owner. My journey into this realm began with agile training courses, which sparked an interest in acquiring a more hands-on understanding of coding - a transition from merely scratching the surface with tutorials to developing substantial tech competency.

My two-decade-long affair with website creation, starting from the days of angelfire.com to tinkering with WordPress, has given me a unique perspective on the evolution of the digital landscape.

Currently, I'm in the midst of a comprehensive coding bootcamp on ![edX](https://img.shields.io/badge/edX-%2302262B.svg?logo=edX&logoColor=white), set to graduate in August 2023. This rigorous yet fulfilling experience has not only deepened my technical understanding but also rekindled my zest for the field of development.

I thrive on challenges that come with learning and creating - a driving force behind my relentless pursuit of mastering the complex world of development. This passion translates into my love for jiu-jitsu, where, much like in coding, constant learning and growth underpin success.

In my quest to become a successful product owner, I am actively seeking opportunities to apply and expand my newfound coding skills in a professional environment. My strong foundation in website creation, coupled with my developing coding expertise, positions me uniquely to bridge the gap between product vision and technical execution. I welcome any collaborations or potential work opportunities. I can't wait to contribute my skills and learn from the best in the industry!
